# Handwritten Digit Recognition

Deep Learning Project – Handwritten Digit Recognition using Python.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.5 +
- Tensorflow
- Numpy
- Keras
- Pillow

## The MNIST dataset
One of the most popular datasets among machine learning and deep learning enthusiasts. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images of handwritten digits from zero to nine and 10,000 images for testing. So, the MNIST dataset has 10 different classes. The handwritten digits images are represented as a 28×28 matrix where each cell contains grayscale pixel value.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) to install __Libraries__.

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install pillow
pip install pandas
pip install keras
pip install tensorflow
```


## Steps to Implement

1. Import the libraries and load the dataset
 First, we are going to import all the modules that we are going to need for training our model. The Keras library already contains some datasets and MNIST is one of them. So we can easily import the dataset and start working with it. The mnist.load_data() method returns us the training data, its labels and also the testing data and its labels.
```python
import keras
from keras.datasets import mnist
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Flatten
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D
from keras import backend as K

# the data, split between train and test sets
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

print(x_train.shape, y_train.shape)
```
2. Preprocess the data
 The image data cannot be fed directly into the model so we need to perform some operations and process the data to make it ready for our neural network. The dimension of the training data is (60000,28,28). 
 The CNN model will require one more dimension so we reshape the matrix to shape (60000,28,28,1).
```python
fx_train = x_train.reshape(x_train.shape[0], 28, 28, 1)
x_test = x_test.reshape(x_test.shape[0], 28, 28, 1)
input_shape = (28, 28, 1)

# convert class vectors to binary class matrices
y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes)
y_test = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, num_classes)

x_train = x_train.astype('float32')
x_test = x_test.astype('float32')
x_train /= 255
x_test /= 255
print('x_train shape:', x_train.shape)
print(x_train.shape[0], 'train samples')
print(x_test.shape[0], 'test samples')
```
3. Create the model.
 ```python
batch_size = 128
num_classes = 10
epochs = 10

model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3),activation='relu',input_shape=input_shape))
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Dropout(0.25))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(256, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))

model.compile(loss=keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy,optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adadelta(),metrics=['accuracy'])
```
4. Train the model.
 The model.fit() function of Keras will start the training of the model. It takes the training data, validation data, epochs, and batch size.

 It takes some time to train the model. After training, we save the weights and model definition in the ‘mnist.h5’ file.

```python
hist = model.fit(x_train, y_train,batch_size=batch_size,epochs=epochs,verbose=1,validation_data=(x_test, y_test))
print("The model has successfully trained")

model.save('mnist.h5')
print("Saving the model as mnist.h5")
```
5. Evaluate the model.
 We have 10,000 images in our dataset which will be used to evaluate how good our model works. The testing data was not involved in the training of the data therefore, it is new data for our model. The MNIST dataset is well balanced so we can get around 99% accuracy.
```python
score = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print('Test loss:', score[0])
print('Test accuracy:', score[1])
```
6. Create GUI to predict digits
 Now for the GUI, we have created a new file in which we build an interactive window to draw digits on canvas and with a button, we can recognize the digit. The Tkinter library comes in the Python standard library. We have created a function predict_digit() that takes the image as input and then uses the trained model to predict the digit.

 Then we create the App class which is responsible for building the GUI for our app. We create a canvas where we can draw by capturing the mouse event and with a button, we trigger the predict_digit() function and display the results.

ii)	Three Layer Convolutional Neural Network using Keras and Theano: 98.75%
